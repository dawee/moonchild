2008-09-20
  upgraded to metalua libraries to git version
    c995760d4ba67c4250ac6029c30ce9491e34ccc2 , which incorporates parsing
    bug patches and new lineinfo/comments in ASTs.
  added: Lua source comments now transfered to C source.
  added: C functions converted from Lua functions are now named based on
         the Lua function name (e.g. "function example()" --> "int
         lcf1_example(lua_State*)").
  refactor: split lua2c.lua into lua2c.lua + ast2cast.lua + cast2string.lua.
  changed: made ast_to_cast reentrant.

  added: support LUA_INIT environment variable.
         Recommended by Shmuel Zeigerman

2008-08-01
  added: -C (C source generation only) command-line switch to clua.
  added: debugging: assert stack checks between statements
  fixed: warning from "unused variable `lc_nextra'"

2008-07-31
  added: -c (compile only) command-line switch to clua.
  fixed numeric ops with metamethods returning non-numbers
  fixed: handle "(error object is not a string)"
  fixed: elseif expression evaluation evaluation order

2008-07-30
  implemented: ignore shebang lines (#...)
  implemented: globals via lua_getfield/lua_setfield/LUA_ENVIRONINDEX
    rather than lua_getglobal/lua_setglobal.
  fixed bug in local function when an upvalue.
  fixed mlp/gg lexer bug in numeric escapes \ddd in strings.
  fixed mlp/gg lexer bug in "\\\n" in strings.
  fixed mlp/gg lexer bug in numbers, e.g. ".1"

2008-07-29
  optimized locals not used as upvalues
  fixed numeric break stack bug
  fixed bug in length (#) op for non-temporary object

2008-07-26
  implemented closures/upvalues.  note: in this initial stage,
    all locals are implemented as upvalues, which is slow
    (this is planned to be improved)
  implemented "local function"
  implemented numeric constants +-inf, nan
  fixed multiassignment
  other bug fixes

2008-07-22
  implemented: vararg (...), command-line arguments,
               unary -, # (length), repeat/until, elseif, `Localrec
  fixed function calls where number of actual parameters not equal
    to number of formal parameters.
  other bug fixes

2008-07-19
  major refactoring: Conversion process is now

    (last two were previously combined)
  renamed lua2c script to clua
  other bug fixes

  implemented: <=, for in, arg
  fixed if stack usage

2008-07-17
  implemented: do, not
  fixed and/or
  other bug fixes

2008-07-16
  implemented: concat, table, method call, assign to locals, while.
  arithmetic binary ops now generate functions rather than inline code.
  many bug fixes

2008-07-15
  initial experimental version
